{"name":"Breeze.BusinessTime","tagline":"Breeze .NET server extensions for enforcing entity authorization and other such business rules in a pipeline","body":"### It's time for business. Breeze business\r\nLet's face it. Breeze Js is awesome and it increases your productivity when building data-centric web apps.  It works especially well when you opt in to its server-side components designed to work with ASP.NET Web API.  \r\n\r\nIn our experience, we've found that it would be beneficial to add to this awesomeness with more explicit control over what happens on the server when trying to do the CUD of CRUD.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Authorization rule validation data-annotations style or fluent configuration via a registry \r\n* Pipeline processing for injecting any set of business rules\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nBreeze.BusinessTime is currently in alpha, so you'll need to fetch the package using the pre-release option. \r\n```\r\nPM> Install-Package Breeze.BusinessTime -Pre\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Use with your normal Breeze Web API controllers\r\n2. Replace your current context provider with an included new shiny one here (May we suggest AuthorizedDbContextProvider<T>?)\r\n3. Add AuthorizeEntity attributes to your model classes (if code first) or use the included RegistryAuthorizationProvider\r\n4. Bob's your uncle\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@timgit","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
